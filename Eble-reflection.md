* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was struggling with the concept and realizations of merge conflicts. It was useful to get to work through one in this GPS session.

The cloning procedure

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Fetch and merge were two things that were clarified here. Fetch in particular I didn't know of beforehand.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

What is the difference between fetch and pull? How does one delete a branch? What is the typical length the guide sticks to for commit messages?

* What still confuses you about Git?

Just the exact step-by-step processes of dealing with GitHub -- for pushing a pulling repos, merging. It's not confusing as it is not second-nature yet; I have to check to make sure I'm doing things correctly sometimes.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I thought it went well. Raymond is a smart guy. Daniel helped out a lot and was able to answer questions clearly and usefully.

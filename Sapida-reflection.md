# Reflection

## What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
The concept I was struggling with the most was merge conflicts.

## What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The concepts on how merge conflicts are resolved, why merge conflicts happen, 
and what happens when git pulls or pushes were all clarified for me by the guide
in the session.

## What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
How are forks treated with respect to each other after they have the different
commits, can one fork pull commits from another? How are git commands related to
each other like git pull to git fetch and git merge?

## What still confuses you about Git?
How multiple upstreams are handled in git and how secure or private
repos are handled.

## How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I had a good experience pairing in my first GPS. I was anxious in the
beginning but my pair and guide were very accomodating.
